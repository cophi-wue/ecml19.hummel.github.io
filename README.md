## Challenges for Computational Literary Studies
### Workshop at the European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML-PKDD 2019)
### Abstract
Digital Humanities have since their beginning in the 1940s adapted methods from computer science. In recent years the time span between invention in computer science and adaption in Digital Humanities has been reduced dramatically and today applications of ‘traditional’ machine learning and deep learning can be found in many DH papers. Nevertheless, direct exchange between researchers in machine learning and in the digital humanities is still rare. In this workshop, we want to bring together both communities and encourage cooperation between researchers from machine learning, natural language processing and digital humanities.
