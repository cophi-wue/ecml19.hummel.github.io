## Challenges for Computational Literary Studies
### Workshop at the European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases ([ECML-PKDD 2019](http://ecmlpkdd2019.org/))

Location: Würzburg University <br/>
Date: 16. September 2019 <br/>

### Abstract
Digital Humanities have since their beginning in the 1940s adapted methods from computer science. In recent years the time span between invention in computer science and adaption in Digital Humanities has been reduced dramatically and today applications of ‘traditional’ machine learning and deep learning can be found in many DH papers. Nevertheless, direct exchange between researchers in machine learning and in the digital humanities is still rare. In this workshop, we want to bring together both communities and encourage cooperation between researchers from machine learning, natural language processing and digital humanities. <br/>
One of the primary goals in the Digital Humanities is the analysis of literary fiction by computational means. This workshop puts a special focus on the development and application of methods in Natural Language Processing in combination with Machine Learning to literary texts. While many of the tasks needed to achieve this goal are also found in other areas of NLP research, literary texts often provide an exceptionally challenging domain for multiple reasons. We intend to provide a forum for the exchange between researchers from machine learning and digital humanities, where these challenges can be addressed together. We believe that, in many cases, the specific challenges posed by literary texts can only be overcome by integrating the domain knowledge of (digital) humanists into machine learning methods.
### Call for Participation
Proposals should meet the standards of the ECML conference and not exceed the maximum of 16 pages. Possible topics include, but are not limited to:
- NLP to support the analysis of long text
- Modeling character constellation with NLP and ML
- Sentiment analysis for literature
- Analysis of emotional states of characters
- Coreference resolution for long documents
- Analysis of indirect characterisation
- Dealing with semantic change in historical texts
- Dealing with dialect in texts
- Social network extraction from text
- Social network analysis from text
- Analysis of character relations
- Machine Learning for analysis of plot
- Text generation of long and complex texts
- Extraction and use of weak labels
- Transfer learning to deal with few labeled information
- Modeling literary text with deep learning
- Knowledge representation for literary (long) texts
- Integrating domain knowledge about literature into machine learning methods <br/>

In addition to that we encourage the submission of late breaking research results with up to 4 pages length.
